# Penguin Flipper Length Regression

This project uses a linear regression model to predict the flipper length of penguins based on various features from the [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). It was developed as part of coursework in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## Features Used
- Species
- Island
- Bill length
- Bill depth
- Body mass

## Model
The model was trained using:
- `scikit-learn` for linear regression
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin-regression.git

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:
   Penguin_flipper_length_activity13_1.ipynb

3. Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate results.
